# Datastore-Challenge
This repository was made for a challenge that involves datastores.

# The Requirements
This challenge requires a basic knowledge of datastores.
It also requires knowledge over multi-threading like task.spawn.
The reason why multi-threading is required is to save performance over multiple tasks.
Pcalls are also required to handle errors.

# The Task
Create a safe datastore suystem that saves a login counter of a person.
The script should create the datastore and pass it over to the modulescript.
The modulescript will proceed to save and load data.
The GetData function will get the current data from the InternalData folder within the player.
The shared.GetData method will be used to 3 seconds after the data has loaded print the value of login counter.

# Mentions
The start code to work with is within the template folder.
If you need any help, the full code is within the finished folder.
For personal help, my discord tag is: vagolla.
(No worries if your code looks differently than mine. It doesn't have to be the same.)

Goodluck everyone who tries this challenge!
